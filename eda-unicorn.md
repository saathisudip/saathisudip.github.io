## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Unicorn Companies
**Purpose : Exploratory Data Analysis**

**Languages, Libraries and Tools : Python, Google Colab, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas, Beautiful Soup**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with the help of graphical representations and statistical techniques. The primary goal of EDA is to uncover patterns, trends, relationships, and potential outliers within the data.During EDA, data analysts or scientists visually inspect and summarize the main features of the dataset, such as the distribution of values, relationships between variables, and any unusual patterns. This process helps in gaining a deeper understanding of the data, identifying potential issues or patterns that may require further investigation, and informing the development of more advanced analytical models.Common techniques used in exploratory data analysis include summary statistics, histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, laying the groundwork for more in-depth analyses and aiding in the formulation of hypotheses for further testing.
  
**Unicorn Companies**
- "Unicorn companies" refer to privately held startup companies with a valuation of over $1 billion. The term was coined to represent the rarity and uniqueness of such companies due to their relatively high valuation in the early stages of their development. Unicorns are often associated with technology and innovation, and examples include companies like Uber, Airbnb, and SpaceX. The concept of unicorn companies has become significant in the startup and venture capital world, symbolizing the success and potential for high returns on investment in these select, high-valued startups.

**Project Description**
-As the technology is evolving on a daily basis, there has been a notable surge in the emergence of unicorn startups over the last 15 years. The list of unicorn companies can be found in wide variety of sources from internet. In this project the unicorn companies data was taken from a business analytics platform called [CBS Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies/). Beautiful soup was used to perform webscraping to get the data from 2007 to 2023 including different fields such as company name, evaluation, geographical distribution, funding sources etc. Data was cleaned and EDA was performed using Python, Pandas and matplotlib. The primary goal of this article is to uncover and aummarize the key characteristics of the data using graphical representatios, and to be able to answer questions such as:

-*Can we get the number of unicorn companies founder per year from 20007 to 2023?*

-*Can we get the distribution of age of unicorn startup versus the valuation in $Billions?*

-*Can we get the names of top 10 most valued companies?*
