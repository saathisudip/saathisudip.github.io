## Exploratory data analysis (EDA) - Unicorn Companies
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with the help of graphical representations and statistical techniques. The primary goal of EDA is to uncover patterns, trends, relationships, and potential outliers within the data.During EDA, data analysts or scientists visually inspect and summarize the main features of the dataset, such as the distribution of values, relationships between variables, and any unusual patterns. This process helps in gaining a deeper understanding of the data, identifying potential issues or patterns that may require further investigation, and informing the development of more advanced analytical models.Common techniques used in exploratory data analysis include summary statistics, histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, laying the groundwork for more in-depth analyses and aiding in the formulation of hypotheses for further testing.
